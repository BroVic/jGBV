Convenience R package for the RAAMP-GBV Assessment

## About this package

The data analysis for the RAAMP-GBV Assessment is quite extensive and
multi-faceted. Also, great care was taken to ensure that the project is
reproducible and extensible.

This package contains R functions and objects that were created to help
us attain those goals. The actual material i.e.Â data, documents, etc. is
domiciled in a separate RStudio project that is not publicly accessible.

## Installation

Requires the `remotes` package:

``` r
remotes::install_github("BroVic/raampGBV")
```
