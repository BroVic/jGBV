# raampGBV
Convenience R package for the RAAMP-GBV Assessment

## About this package
The data analysis for the RAAMP-GBV Assessment is quite extensive and multi-faceted. Also, great care was taken to ensure that the project is reproducible and extensible.

This package contains R functions and objects that were created to help us attain those goals. The actual material i.e. data, documents, etc. is domiciled in a separate RStudio project that is not publicly accessible.

## Installation
Requires the `remotes` package:
```r
remotes::install_github("BroVic/raampGBV")
```
