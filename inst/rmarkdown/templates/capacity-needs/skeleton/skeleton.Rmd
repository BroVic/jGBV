# Capacity of First Responders
The availability of designated or trained GBV first-responders was assessed in the various facilities. Of the `r nrow(capdata)` establishments, `r statGBV(capdata, "perc", 'gbv')` do not have GBV focal persons but have staff randomly providing GBV services when clients present. Out of `r statGBV(allcap$health, 'total', 'gbv')` respondents rendering healthcare services, only `r statGBV(allcap$health, 'sum', 'gbv')` (`r statGBV(allcap$health, 'perc', 'gbv')`) are designated GBV focal persons for their respective facilities. However, a greater proportion of law enforcement agencies had GBV focal persons -- `r statGBV(allcap$law, 'perc', 'gbv')` agencies assessed. Other service provider areas seem to have higher preponderance of designated personnel as `r statGBV(allcap$legal, 'sum', 'gbv')` out of `r statGBV(allcap$legal, 'total', 'gbv')` (`r statGBV(allcap$legal, 'perc', 'gbv')`) assessed that provide legal aid are GBV focal persons, `r statGBV(allcap$shelter, 'sum', 'gbv')` out of `r statGBV(allcap$shelter, 'total', 'gbv')` (`r statGBV(allcap$shelter, 'perc', 'gbv')`) providers in temporary shelter and `r statGBV(allcap$psycho, 'sum', 'gbv')` out of `r statGBV(allcap$psycho, 'total', 'gbv')` (`r statGBV(allcap$psycho, 'perc', 'gbv')`) in those providing psycho-social support.  

Analysis by sex showed proportion of female GBV service providers in the health (`r statGBV(allcap$health, 'perc', 'gender')`), temporary shelter (`r statGBV(allcap$shelter, 'perc', 'gender')`) and legal aid sectors (`r statGBV(allcap$legal, 'perc', 'gender')`). In the law enforcement sector, `r statGBV(allcap$law, 'perc', 'gender')` were female officers while `r paste0(100 - as.numeric(sub("^(\\d+\\.?\\d{1})(%)$", "\\1", statGBV(allcap$psycho, 'perc', 'gender'))), "%")` of the operators providing psycho-social support were male.

# Available Skills and Knowledge
## Health Services
The accompanying chart shows that of the `r nrow(allcap$health)` facilities providing healthcare services, `r statGBV(allcap$health, 'perc', fixOffset(6))` have received training in HIV/STI testing and treatment; other clinical skills for which they have been trained include effective referrals (`r statGBV(allcap$health, 'perc', fixOffset('referrals', allcap$health))`), examination and treatment of adolescent survivors (`r statGBV(allcap$health, 'perc', fixOffset('examination and treat', allcap$health))`) as well as emergency contraception (`r statGBV(allcap$health, 'perc', fixOffset('contraceptive', allcap$health))`). In terms of communication and documentation, `r statGBV(allcap$health, 'perc', fixOffset('communication', allcap$health))` have been trained on effective communication, `r statGBV(allcap$health, 'perc', fixOffset('documentation', allcap$health))` on documentation, while `r statGBV(allcap$health, 'perc', fixOffset('confidentiality', allcap$health))` have been trained on maintaining patient confidentiality.

However, there is a general lack of capacity on psychosocial support counseling (LIVES) and basic care for post-GBV survivors, as only `r statGBV(allcap$health, 'sum', fixOffset('referrals', allcap$health))` (`r empty_place()`) of healthcare workers have been trained. Findings also showed that only one-fifth of those interviewed have received basic training on GBV (`r empty_place()`), clinical management of rape (`r empty_place()`) and clinical management of rape services for children (`r empty_place()`).

Overall, low capacity was recorded in medico-legal report writing (`r statGBV(allcap$health, 'perc', fixOffset('medico', allcap$health))`), testifying in court (`r statGBV(allcap$health, 'perc', fixOffset('testify', allcap$health))`) and forensic examination (`r statGBV(allcap$health, 'perc', fixOffset('forensic', allcap$health))`). This indicates that most GBV survivors willing to press charges against suspected perpetrators may find it difficult to get justice because forensic evidence and testifying in courts are key requirements.

```

## Law Enforcement
A total of `r nrow(allcap$law)` law enforcement officers were assessed and `r statGBV(allcap$law, 'sum', fixOffset('safety', allcap$law))` of them have received the requisite essential GBV training in subjects ranging from safety planning (`r statGBV(allcap$law, 'perc', fixOffset('safety', allcap$law))`), ‘how to testify in court’ (`r statGBV(allcap$law, 'perc', fixOffset('testify', allcap$law))`), patient confidentiality (`r statGBV(allcap$law, 'perc', fixOffset('confidentiality', allcap$law))`), and effective communication (`r statGBV(allcap$law, 'perc', fixOffset('communication', allcap$law))`). However, only `r statGBV(allcap$law, 'perc', fixOffset('forensic', allcap$law))` have been trained on forensic examination. The inability of a significant proportion of officers to conduct forensic examinations may affect the success prosecutions in court.

```

## Legal Aid Services
```{r}
nleg <- nrow(allcap$legal)
nconf <- allcap$legal %>% statGBV('sum', fixOffset('confidentiality', .))
```

Only `r nleg` legal aid service providers were assessed -- `r if (nconf == nleg) "all" else nconf` have received the requisite training on maintaining patient confidentiality as well as on effective communication. `r allcap$legal %>% statGBV('perc', fixOffset('safety', .))` had received training on safety planning and on basic GBV interventions. Only `r allcap$legal %>% statGBV('sum', fixOffset('testify', .))` individual said that they had knowledge about the following: laws and policies on GBV and human rights; proper documentation and basic psychosocial support counseling; effective referrals; and handling of GBV case evidence (`r allcap$legal %>% statGBV('perc', fixOffset('testify', .))`).

```{r legal-chart, eval = gt_one(allcap$legal), fig.cap="GBV-related Training for Legal Aid Providers"}

```

## Psycho-Social Support Services
Out of the `r nrow(allcap$psycho)` psycho-social support service providers assessed, `r statGBV(allcap$psycho, 'perc', fixOffset('survivor', allcap$psycho))` have the skills to offer survivor-centred post-GBV interventions. `r statGBV(allcap$psycho, 'sum', fixOffset('understanding', allcap$psycho))` have been trained on effective communication and provision of post GBV care; effective referrals and follow-up, gender mainstreaming, guiding principles of case management, prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse. 

```{r psycho-chart, eval = gt_one(allcap$psycho), fig.cap="GBV-related Training for Psycho-Social Support Providers"}

```

## Temporary Shelter Services
Of the 2 safe homes only 1 of them was trained in provision of post-GBV care. `r empty_place()` indicated being trained in the following: effective communication; effective referrals, survivor-centred approaches; guiding principles of case management, and of post-GBV care; mental health; safety, security and dignity in shelters/settlements; and prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse.
