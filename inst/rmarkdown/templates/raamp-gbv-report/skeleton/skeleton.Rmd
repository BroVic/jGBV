Quantitative data were collected and analysed from a total of `r total.respondents` respondents across six (6) sectors - health facilities, social support services, legal aid services, judicial services, law enforcement/security agencies, and temporary shelters (safe homes) in each of the `r length(lgas_ng(params$state))` Local Government Areas (LGAs) of `r params$state` State. Also for the qualitative data, a total of `r length(list.files(glue("data/qual/{stateForPaths}/{transcripts.dir}"), pattern = "\\.txt", recursive = TRUE))` interviews comprising indepth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted, in the same LGAs as well as for selected state-level stakeholders.

In line with the objectives of the assessment, the data were analysed in the following areas:

1. GBV prevention and response service availability across sectors 
2. Existing referral pathways between services, opportunities for improved coordination, and referral directories with contact information
3. Facilitators and barriers to survivors seeking post-GBV care
4. Capacity needs of first responders across sectors
5. Respondents' recommendations

| S/N|  Sector           | No. of respondents       |
|:---|:------------------|:-------------------------|
| 1. | Health            | `r nrow(health.data)`    | 
| 2. | Law Enforcement   | `r nrow(security.data)`  | 
| 3. | Legal Aid         | `r nrow(legal.data)`     | 
| 4. | Judicial          | `r nrow(judicial.data)`  | 
| 5. | Social support    | `r nrow(social.data)`    |
| 6. | Temporary shelter | `r nrow(temporary.data)` |
|    | **Total**         |**`r total.respondents`** |

The analysis of facilities visited per LGA is as follows:

```{r table_facilities_visited}
my_flextable(common.data, "Facilities visited in each LGA for each sector") %>%
  set_header_labels(
    lgas = "LGA",
    Health = "Health (10)*",
    Judicial = "Judicial (3)",
    Legal = "Legal (2)",
    Security = "Security (5)",
    Shelter = "Shelter (5)",
    Social = "Social (10)"
  )
```

For the quantitative data, the questionnaire had fields related to the facility being surveyed; multi-option, check-list style questions;  straightforward all-or-none questions; and open-ended questions. Thus, for several variables studied, the sampling frame exceeds the actual number of the respondents, which were harnessed in the course of data transformation. For instance, the health facility data collection tool had 144 data fields of which 11 were introductory/overview questions (e.g. location of facility, age of respondent), followed by fields addressing the research questions (e.g. GBV in a given community, GBV case load in the facility, etc). There was considerable overlap in the line of questioning across the sectors, which allowed for inter-sectoral comparative analyses.

Quantitative data were downloaded from REDCap server in comma-separated-values (CSV) file format and then cleaned, transformed and analysed using R, a programming language and environment for statistical computing. Along with the data, the metadata were downloaded from REDCap. These were machine-generated by the REDCap server and after download, were parsed to extract variable labels and other important values.

For qualitative data, IDIs were conducted with community leaders, local government officials, officials from each of the surveyed sectors as well as key stakeholders operating at the State level. The FGDs were held at the community level and dichotomised along the line of participants' gender i.e. one FGD for women and another exclusively for men. All sessions were fully recorded and transcribed by trained field workers prior to being subjected to the analysis.

### GBV occurrence, prevention and response service availability across sectors  
```{r table_gbv_occurence_sectors, anchor = "table", tab.cap = "Distribution of GBV Occurrence"}
tbl <- get_gbv_occur_data(common.data) %>% 
  split_dot_names %>% 
  freq(name) 

printed.tbl <- tbl %>%
  format %>%
  filter(item != "NA") %>%
  flextable %>%
  set_caption("Table 4: Distribution of GBV Occurrence") %>%
  set_header_labels(
    item = "Type of GBV",
    count = "Count",
    percent = "Percent",
    cum_count = "Cum. Count",
    cum_percent = "Cum. Percent"
  )

gbvs <- get_gbvs_as_vector(common.data)

for (i in seq_len(nrow(tbl))) {
  val <- tbl$percent[tbl$item == gbvs[i]]
  obj <- paste0("percent.", tolower(abbreviate(gbvs[i])))
  assign(obj, compute_percent(val))
}
printed.tbl
```

From Table 4 above, `r tbl$item[which.max(tbl$count)]` was identified as the commonest form of GBV in `r params$state` State (`r tbl$percent[which.max(tbl$count)] %>% compute_percent`%). This was followed by `r tbl$item[2]` (`r tbl$percent[2] %>% compute_percent`%),  `r tbl$item[3]` (`r tbl$percent[3] %>% compute_percent`%),  `r tbl$item[4]` (`r tbl$percent[4] %>% compute_percent`%) and  `r tbl$item[5]` (`r tbl$percent[5] %>% compute_percent`%).  `r tbl$item[which.min(tbl$count)]` was reported the least occurring form of GBV (`r tbl$percent[which.min(tbl$count)] %>% compute_percent`%) in the state. These findings were corroborated by FGDs and IDIs as respondents highlighted the following as forms of GBV that occur in their communities.

IPV was identified as a growing problem by interviewees, mostly being prepetrated against women:

<!--
QUOTES
-->

Another kind of IPV identified was that directed toward domestic helpers and in non-marital relationships:

<!--
QUOTES
-->

Some cases of IPV have been attributed to financial problems in families: 

<!--
QUOTES
-->

**Rape**
Cases of rape to occur, but less commonly than IPV:

<!--
QUOTES
-->

Persons with disability have been identified as being particular at risk as occured in this instance:

<!--
QUOTES
-->

**Child Sexual Abuse**  

This form occurs in the communities as well and is referred to as *defilement*:

<!--
QUOTES
-->

    value = unname(round(res))
  )
}

gbvs <- get_gbvs_as_vector(common.data)

for (g in gbvs[1:3]) {
  for (i in 1:3) {
    obj <- fetch_tbl_vals(tbl, g, nth = i)
    nm <- abbreviate(g)
    assign(paste0(nm, i), value = obj)
  }
}
```

Table 5 shows the occurrence of various forms of GBV as reported by study participants in the `r length(this.lgas)` LGAs. Participants reported the occurrence of rape, IPV and child sexual abuse as forms of GBV in their localities. IPV was reported as the commonest occurring GBV in `r sum(max.is.inpv)` LGAs: `r this.lgas[max.is.inpv]`. LGAs with most participants reporting the occurrence of IPV were `r InPV1$name` (`r InPV1$value`%), `r InPV2$name` (`r InPV2$value`%) and `r InPV3$name` (`r InPV3$value`%). The preponderance of rape over IPV was reported in `r dimnames(tbl)$lgas[which(tbl[, 1] < tbl[, 2])]`. Respondents from `r Rape1$name` reported the highest rape (`r Rape1$value`%), followed by `r Rape2$name` and `r Rape3$name` (`r Rape2$value`% and `r Rape3$value`%, respectively), while those in `r dimnames(tbl)$lgas[which.min(tbl[, 2])]` reported the least (`r min(tbl[, 2])`%). 

Sexual coercion, forced marriage (FM) and female genital mutilation (FGM) were not reported as forms of GBV in one, two and five LGAs, respectively. LGAs that reported high occurrence of these forms of GBV were:  Umuahia North and South (22% and 20%, respectively) for sexual coercion; Ugwunnagbo (16%) and Ukwa West (14%) forced marrriage, while the highest reported FGM occurence was in Obingwa (12%).

### Types of GBV addressed across different sectors
Respondents in the various facilities were asked about the types of GBV they address at their workplaces.

```{r table_gbv_addressed, anchor = "table", tab.cap = "Proportion of GBV case being addressed by respective sectors"}
gbv.addressed.data <- get_gbv_addressed_data(common.data)

```
  
From Figure xx and Table xx above, physical assault is the commonest form of GBV addressed by the health sector (25%), followed by IPV (22%) and sexual assault (19%). Although, all the six sectors assessed in `r params$state` State address child sexual abuse, temporary shelters surveyed to not have such cases; they also did not address any forced marriage or FGM cases. Rather, up to 1/2 of the cases seen in these facilities were IPV.

### Case Load
<!-- Respondents were asked how many GBV cases they had encountered in their facilities/agencies in the last 12 months (Table 7). -->

```{r table_cases_12months, tab.cap = "GBV Cases Reported in last 12 months by LGA", anchor = "table"}

to_char_add_dash <- function(x) {

```

Table 7 above, shows number of GBV cases seen by respondents in their various sectors across `r nrow(df)` LGAs in the last 12 months. Umuahia North LGA appears to have seen the highest number of GBV cases (693), followed by Ikwuano (494), Ukwa West (382) and Aba South (307). The social support sector was the overall dominant source of cases - in Aba South (154), Umu Nneochi (147), and Umuahia North (90). The health sector attended to the bulk of cases in Umuahia North (530). Overall, the LGAs with the lowest case loads were Ukwa East (55) and Osisioma (90).

sapply(other.sectors, function(x) {
  obj <- paste0("med.", abbreviate(x))
  assign(obj, median.sector(x), envir = globalenv())
})
```

From the chart above (Figure 4), there is a median case load of `r med` for `r params$state` State 12 months prior to this assessment. However, there were some outlier facilities that recorded between `r paste0(top5[1], "-", top5[2])` cases cases during the period under review. On the other hand, the median number of cases seen by social support services, legal aid services, security agencies, judicial services were `r med.Socl`, `r med.Legl`, `r med.Scrt` and `r med.Jdcl`, respectively. The median case load for the health sector and shelter homes were `r med.Hlth` and `r med.Shlt`, respectively


#### Reporting or seeking care for GBV  
Qualitative findings from interviews with members of the communities, indicate that logistic difficulties play a role in the survivors' decision to report GBV or seek care. Some of the challenges cited include distance to the facility and the cost attached to services. For example, one respondent had this to say:

#### Payment made for GBV services

**Figure 5: Payment for GBV Services by Sectors**  
```{r plot_payment, anchor = "figure"}
payment.data <-
  if (identical(params$state, "Bauchi") ||
      identical(params$state, "Abia")) {
    short_merge(dfList, common.questions["pay_services"]) %>%
      filter(!is.na(response))
  } else {
    common.data %>%
      prepare_extended_col("pay_services", pay.services) %>%
      rename(response = name)
  }

tbl <- with(payment.data, table(response, sector))

payment.data %>%
  mutate(response = factor(response, levels = c("Yes", "No"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(sector, fill = response)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = (..count..)/sum(..count..)), position = "fill", col = "red", width = .7) +
  xlab("Sector") +
  ylab("Percentage") +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Accent")
```

Figure xx above shows that close to 3/4 of health facilities demand payment for GBV services. This is followed by legal aid, where about 1/4 of the facilities confirmed that payment is required. About 14% of law enforcement agencies require payments while a much smaller number of social support facilities do (7%). However, all the temporary shelters seem to all be offering free services.

### Age Range of GBV Survivors
```{r table_age_range, tab.cap = "Age range of GBV survivors (percentages by sector)", anchor = "table"}
dtbl <- common.data %>%
  prepare_extended_col("age_range", age.range) %>%
  mutate(name = ordered(
    name,
    levels = c(
      "X..5.yrs",
      "X5.9.yrs",
      "X10.14.yrs",
      "X15.19.yrs",
      "X..20.yrs"),
    labels = age.range
  ))

with(dtbl, prop.table(table(name, sector), 2)) %>%
  round(3) %>%
  compute_percent %>%
  as.data.frame %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = sector, values_from = Freq) %>%
  flextable() %>%
  colformat_num(
    j = c("Health", "Judicial", "Legal", "Security", "Shelter", "Social"),
    digits = 1
  ) %>%
  set_caption("Age range of GBV survivors that seek care (%)") %>%
  set_header_labels(name = "")
```
Table 7 reveals that fewer number of under-5 GBV survivors seek care across all sectors. This is more pronounced in the legal aid sector (4.2%). Overall, the number of cases attended to increased with age across all sectors.

### OverView of GBV Service Sectors
#### Health Sector
##### a.	Services provided by Health facilities

```

```{r table_services_provided_health, include=FALSE}
hlth.serv.tbl <- make_ptbl(get_services_health(health.data))

```
Of the services rendered at health faclities in the State, 35% are psychosocial support services. Only 4.9% of services rendered are targeted at protection childhood GBV survivors, while 3.6% is legal aid/law enforcement interventions. About 2% of of the Facilities offer shelter to victims. as well as economic empowerment.

Of the available policies, protocols and/or guidelines in the health facilities, SOPs were most commonly encountered in `r ptbl["Standard.Operating.Procedures"]`% of cases, followed closely by Policies and Protocols  (`r ptbl["Policies"]`% and `r ptbl["Protocols"]`%, respectively). Quality assurance standards (`r ptbl["Quality.assurance.standards"]`%) and algorithms (`r ptbl["Algorithms"]`%) were the least commonly encountered (Figure 10a). Of the standard forms assessed, Client Intake, HIV Consent, GBV Consent and Safety Assessment forms were found in `r forms.tbl["Client.intake.assessment.form"]`%, `r forms.tbl["Consent.form.for.HIV.testing"]`%, `r forms.tbl["Consent.form.for.GBV.examination.and.care"]`% and `r forms.tbl["Safety.assessment.forms"]`% of the facilities, respectively (Figure 10b).

Of the available SOPs in the health facilities, those for referral and coordination were most commonly available, while those for child-friendliness were the least commonly available (Figure 10c).

From figures xx above, although significant gaps exist in the availability of medical equipment for GBV services, there are existing infrastructures to leverage on to strengthen these services. For example, a good number of the facilities visited had consulting, waiting and private rooms with toilet facilities, furniture and examination tables. However, other equipment, such as computer and electricity were grossly inadequate (86% and 48%, respectively. Water supply was also not available in up to 44% of the facilities.

Figure 27 is the output of essential drugs available at the health facilities. Analgesics and tetanus toxoid vaccines were available in most (95% and 93%, respectively) of the facilities; and more than 80% of them had Pregnancy test kits, emergency contraceptives (77%) and antibiotics (85%). Although HIV test kits were found in 88.5% of the facilities, 63% of them had drugs for HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (HIV-PEP) and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The least available items in the health sector for GBV service delivery were female hygiene materials such as sanitary pads as well as resuscitation material/equipment (Figure 26).

Post-GBV Care offered by health care facilities was equally assessed, covering a range of service and intervention areas:

None of the tertiary health facilities surveyed had the minimum GBV care package of treatment of acute injuries; HIV PEP; emergency contraception; HIV testing, counselling, linkage to treatment; STI testing and treatment; and psychosocial counselling. 3% of primary and 33% of secondary health facilities offer the minimum package.

The data show that majority of health facilities lack trained staff equipped with the requisite skills for offering post-GBV care to survivors. Across most service areas, less than 1/3 had the capacity to provide services. There is also a severe shortage in social workers and staff able to administer clinical management of rape (27%). Only 14% can testify in court and 13% are training to work with child survivors.

The qualitative data provided additional insights - majority of health workers from primary health care facilities expressed the lack of training, while those from general hospitals stated that they received regular training; one said:

Legal Aid Services tend to rely principally on extant laws and codes as standard documents to guide their service delivery to GBV survivors.

Social support facilities in `r params$state` State primarily offer psychosocial, economic empowerment and child protection interventions to GBV survivors (Figure 8). The social services mostly delivered psychosocial GBV interventions (27.59%), economic empowerment (17.24%) and child protection services (14.37%). Very few actually shelter GBV victims (4.02%). According to one of the respondents, they offer the aforementioned services and refer survivors to other facilities as needed.

In comparing the sectors, health did relatively well in protecting the confidentiality of GBV survivors, according to `r confid.tbl["Yes", "Health"]`% of those surveyed, followed by `r confid.tbl["Yes", "Shelter"]`% of temporary shelters. However, most of the other were in the affirmative on the confidentiality and protection of the data of GBV survivors (Figure 16). Some of the measures taken by some facilities to ensure confidentiality of GBV victims include locking records away, maintaining a special unit, etc. Here are some quotes from the interviews done in a particular LGA.

When asked to volunteer information on what happened to GBV cases attended to respondents had these to say during the qualitative interviews across sectors.

24/7 services are being offered by as many as 54.6% of surveyed facilities. Many of the facilities not offering round-the-clock service are in the social support service sector, followed by the legal aid services. Plotting the graph by proportions reveals that the majority of health and social support services are not always open for business. Those not offering services round-the-clock worked mostly on weekdays as shown in (Figure 18) above.

## Existing Referral Pathways between Services, Opportunities for Improved Coordination, and Referral Directories with Contact Information
### Referral Pathways and Directory
As part of efforts to determine the existing services and ensure improved and coordinated Gender based violence (GBV) service delivery in each state, detailed contact information of organizations and facilities where GBV survivors are referred to in each of the LGAs was collected and collated.  Research Assistants collected as many information as possible from each of the six key sectors providing GBV services such as health, legal aid, court, law enforcement, social support and temporary shelter. Names and addresses of referral organizations, name and phone number of contact person, hours of operation as well as type of GBV services offered were also collected. Upon collection of data, some of the facilities were visited to confirm if they actually provide such services as reported by the respondents. After data cleaning and removal of duplicates, sorting of records with complete contact information, especially phone numbers led to a further reduction of the records 104. After the data cleaning, a desk review and verification was conducted through phone calls to all the facilities listed. During this process, the enlisted contact persons were asked questions on the type of GBV services they provide to validate the information on our records. Corrections were also made to incomplete or wrong addresses.

#### `r params$state` State
A total of `r numReferralCentres` referral records were collated across all LGAs in the state. However, after cleaning and removal of duplicates, the records were reduced and sorting of records with complete contact information, especially phone numbers led to a further reduction of the records. After the data cleaning, a desk review and verification were conducted through phone calls to all the facilities listed. During this process, the enlisted contact persons were asked questions on the type of GBV services they provide to validate the data gathered from the field. Corrections were also made to incomplete or wrong addresses. Findings from the phone call verification showed the facilities provide GBV services. <!-- Update with data relevant to cleaning/validation carried out for a given state -->

### Referral pathways for Health Services
```{r table_referral_health, include=FALSE}
referral.health <- get_referral_data(health.data)

ref.health.tbl <- report_table(referral.health, "q_48")

ref.health.lga.tbl <- 
  report_table(referral.health, "lgas", "q_48")
ref.health.lga.tbl
```

Data were also collected on the patterns of referrals conducted across the different sectors. For instance, out of the `r nrow(referral.health)` health facilities surveyed, `r nrow(subset(referral.health, q_48 == "Yes"))` refer GBV victims to law enforcement.

```

```{r combo_referrals_jud_and_leg}

Judicial services make most of their referrals to the health sector and to the Police (44% and 38%), while the `r prop`% of legal aid services make referrals to the Police.

### Referral Pathway for Social Support Services

```


```{r table_referrals_social_to_others, include=FALSE}
ref.soc.other.tbl <- report_table(referral.social, "q26")
ref.soc.other.tbl
```

`r ref.soc.pol.tbl["Yes"]`% of social support services make regular referrals to the police. However, less of them make referrals to other social service sector players (`r ref.soc.other.tbl["Yes"]`%). The qualitative data paint a similar picture:

Analyzing GBV coordination by sectors, most of the health facilities surveyed participate in such activities in their various communities. Participation in local coordination meetings was the lowest from the law enforcement and security agencies, and up to 20% of health facilities did not participate either. There is 100% participation in these meetings from the social support services surveyed.

# DISCUSSION

## GBV prevention and response service availability across sectors
<!--
Across the state, IPV, rape and child abuse were the commonest form of GBV. This is in line with findings from several studies conducted in other states in Nigeria such as the 2017 GBV assessment conducted by MCSP in Kogi and Ebonyi states which found sexual abuse to be the commonest form of GBV. Also, findings from NDHS 2013 shows that 3 out of 10 girls have experienced one form of sexual abuse. 

The GBV types that were being addressed by the various sectors link directly to the GBV cases reported/presented at the sectors/facilities. The preponderance of cases associated with physical violence and assault are being addressed in the health sector. This links directly to the data on most common GBV presenting issues in the health sector being physical injuries, all of which are all related to physical violence and assault. This direct link between reported and addressed cases cuts across all the sectors.

When viewed across the LGAs, it is noted that Umuahia North is the LGA with the highest number of recorded GBV cases (693 cases).  Its emergence as the LGA with the highest report of GBV cases could be related to its urbanized nature. Studies have shown that industrialization and urbanization can power GBV. The low case load of GBV case load in the health sector when relative to other sectors suggests a relatively lower utilization of health facilities when compared to other sectors such as the legal aid sector which had the highest relative cased load of GBV cases in the last 12 months. This is contrary to what obtains based on previous studies. According to Fawole et al, 2019, In settings where the criminal justice sector is weak or victim-blaming is high such as in Nigeria, survivors of GBV are often more likely to visit a health facility than report to a police station or other sectors in the aftermath of an assault. Additionally, health providers are often respected, objective arbiters, particularly in settings where women may fear the police (García-Moreno C, Hegarty K, d’Oliveira AFL, et al. 2014). Therefore, this relatively low case load may be due to the fact that most of the payment required for GBV services based on the data from this study came from the health sector relative to the other sector addressed such as Legal aid and social services sectors whose services required no payments. User fees has been established as a deterrent to the use of services. Qualitative findings from the FGDs also shows that logistic difficulties play a role in the survivors’ decision to report GBV or seek care. Some of the challenges cited include distance to the facility and the cost attached to services.

Many health facilities (58.4%) did not have the standard forms for managing GBV cases. Client Intake, HIV Consent, GBV Consent and Safety Assessment forms were found in 20.14%, 17.71%, 16.67% and 14.93% of the facilities, respectively. Of the available SOPs in the health facilities, those for referral and coordination were most commonly available, those for child-friendliness were the least commonly available. The dire absence of child friendly documents as well as materials was also noted across all the other sectors

On a general note, the use of standard documents to guide care-givers in rendering GBV services, was inadequate state-wide. Across all sectors, documentation is poor. Also, the availability of child friendly guides/documents for child survivor is notably low. This finding is in line with a report by the Federal Ministry of Health in 2014 which pointed out that adolescent girls aged 10-19 years are especially vulnerable to GBV and experience elevated risks of sexual violence, exploitation and early and forced marriage, but are often not specifically targeted for provision of sexual and reproductive health care due to gender and social norms and sometimes healthcare provider bias. Children are more vulnerable than adults to abuse, due to their age, size and limited participation in decision-making. Specific measures should be implemented to protect girls and boys from the risk of child sexual abuse at home, school and in the community. Health service providers, teachers, parents, caregivers and others should be aware of the signs and symptoms of child sexual abuse, as girls and boys will often remain silent. Services should be provided in a non-discriminatory manner, with the informed assent and/or consent of the child or consent of their caregiver. Child survivors and their families have specific needs and require a tailored response and specialized services

Across all the sectors, the respondents highlighted issues like lack of equipment, consumables, lack of working materials as well as lack of funds as some of the challenges that currently plagues the provision of GBV services within the state.

Existing referral pathways between services, opportunities for improved coordination, and referral directories with contact information

Despite pockets of GBV prevention and response efforts scattered all over the state, there remains an apparent lack of coordination and at times total lack of co-ordination to prevent and respond to GBV survivors within minimum standards. Respondents in some of the sectors expressed some concerns with inter-agency referrals such as cases of survivors being molested in some sectors such as in the law enforcement. Local co-ordination among key players in the law enforcement and security agencies is also particularly low. 

Notably, there is a dearth of shelter/safe home services in Abia State, as evidenced by the low sample size as well as expression of need by many of the respondents in the IDIs and FGDs.

## Facilitators and barriers to survivors seeking post-GBV care
<!--
Some of the barriers to seeking care includes Stigma, threats and intimidation by powerful people in the society and financial/logistical constraints affecting survivors, members of the community and service providers. Some of the facilitators of GBV survivors seeking care identified by respondents includes increased awareness and sensitisation, strong community support structures such as women and youth associations as well as government interventions.
-->
## Capacity needs of first responders across sectors
<!--
Only 14 (8.2%) health facilities of the 170 facilities surveyed across the state had the capacity to provide all the minimum post GBV care package; none of these were tertiary centres. The data also show that majority of health care facilities do not have adequate trained staff equipped with the requisite skills for offering post-GBV care to survivors. Across all service areas, less than 1/3 had the capacity to provide services such as clinical management of rape, training on how to care for Child survivors, training on testifying in court etc.

There are minimum standards for prevention and response of gender-based violence particularly for medical and psychosocial services to strengthen existing health and protection systems and these standards provide guidance on working with survivors. However, when healthcare providers are not trained on the guiding principles of working with survivor’s protocols may not be adhered to. Also, survivors may be at heightened risk of additional harm or violence from partners, family and/or community members if confidentiality, respect and safety are not adhered to. Furthermore, healthcare workers should provide necessary, life-saving care, such as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for HIV; emergency contraception; treatment for sexually transmitted infections (STIs); mental health and psychosocial support; and appropriate referrals for legal and other services that can support survivors and prevent their re-victimization. (WHO, 2014). Also survivors may fail to seek services ; if the health facility does not have private spaces for consultation, protocols for provision of health care to survivors, essential medicine and supplies or confidential mechanisms for documentation and referrals; if communication materials in the facility do not make clear the types of services that are available, and that they are available for all; or if the provider states or implies that the disclosure of GBV will not be met with respect, sympathy and confidentiality.
